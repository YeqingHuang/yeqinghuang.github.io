## My Personal Website

This is one of my projects for the course _CS5610 Web Development_ at Northeastern University. For now, it has a homepage which shows my resume, some of my projects and my social links.  
You can find the [demo here](https://yeqinghuang.github.io/), or refer to [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pbm0dqsHG0e5QT8eDDRXc9jfq1uYHwS87IEvrANNRm0/edit?usp=sharing) or a [5-min video](https://www.youtube.com/) in which I talked about it.

### Resoures

Fantastic libraries:
