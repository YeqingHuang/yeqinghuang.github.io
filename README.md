## My Personal Website

This is one of my projects for the course _CS5610 Web Development_ at Northeastern University. You can find the [demo here](https://yeqinghuang.github.io/), or refer to [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pbm0dqsHG0e5QT8eDDRXc9jfq1uYHwS87IEvrANNRm0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Resoures

Fantastic libraries:

1. [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/): Provide animation effect of typing strings and backspacing at customized speed.
2. [jquery easing](https://jqueryui.com/easing/): Specify the speed of an animation at different points within the animation.
3. [boxicons](https://boxicons.com/): High quality web icons that you can edit and use.   

The original template is [iPortfolio](https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/iPortfolio/) made by [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/).  
The color scheme I used comes from this [blog](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/).
